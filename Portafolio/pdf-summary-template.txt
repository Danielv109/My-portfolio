CORE COMPETENCIES
-----------------
• Firewall Administration (Fortinet/Palo Alto)  • SD-WAN & Network Security
• SIEM/SOAR (Microsoft Sentinel/Splunk)        • Incident Response & Troubleshooting
• Zero Trust Architecture (ZTNA)               • Compliance (ISO 27001, PCI DSS, DORA, NIS2)

KEY PROJECTS & IMPACT
--------------------

1. PERIMETER & SD-WAN SECURITY
   Problem: Reduce exposed services and improve link reliability
   Solution: HA FortiGate cluster with BGP/OSPF, SSL inspection, IPS
   Results: ↓ 40% exposed services | ↑ 30% inspected traffic | ↓ 18% latency

2. SIEM DETECTION & SOAR AUTOMATION
   Problem: Reduce mean time to detection and automate response
   Solution: Microsoft Sentinel with custom KQL, automated playbooks
   Results: ↓ 65% MTTD | ↑ 80% automated response | ↓ 45% false positives

3. PCI DSS COMPLIANCE HARDENING
   Problem: Achieve PCI compliance through segmentation and encryption
   Solution: Network segmentation, TLS 1.2+ enforcement, centralized logging
   Results: ↑ 98% PCI compliance score | ↓ 75% vulnerabilities | ↑ 90% audit readiness

4. ZERO TRUST NETWORK ACCESS
   Problem: Replace traditional VPN with application-specific access
   Solution: Palo Alto Prisma SASE with continuous verification
   Results: ↓ 40% latency vs VPN | ↑ 55% security posture | ↓ 30% help desk tickets

COMPLIANCE EXPERTISE
-------------------
✓ ISO 27001 - Network controls, incident management, risk assessment
✓ PCI DSS - Cardholder data protection, network segmentation, encryption
✓ DORA - ICT risk management, detection capabilities, incident reporting
✓ NIS2 - Cybersecurity hygiene, risk management measures, supply chain security

OPERATIONAL RUNBOOKS
-------------------
• VPN Brute-Force Incident Response (10-step, 90-minute procedure)
• Firewall Policy Change Control (CAB-approved, automated expiration)
• SSL/TLS Decryption Exception Workflow (risk-based, compensating controls)
